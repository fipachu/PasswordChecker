# PasswordChecker
Script source code in [game.py](./Password%20Checker/task/game.py). Why it's called 'game.py' I don't know, ask Hyperskill.

I like the results of this one, maybe in the future I'm gonna expand it
beyond v1.0, for fun and experience.

## Possible improvements
- add command line option for setting minimum length of passwords, default to 0
- asses password strength
