<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Now that you're comfortable with user interaction, it's time to improve the functionality of your program. Implement a simple password validation and an essential security measure â€” password length. Any software developer must be able to validate input and implement simple security measures. Checking the password length, in particular, is a fundamental and widely used security measure.</p>
<p>Your program should be able to interact with the user, validate their password, and implement a simple security measure by the end of this stage. You're one step closer to having a secure password checker!</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Your program should accomplish the following at this stage:</p>
<ol>
<li>Request that the user enter their password;</li>
<li>Examine the password's length. Display a warning message that the password is too short if it is less than eight characters long. Confirm that the password has been received if it's <strong>eight characters</strong> or longer.</li>
<li>If the password is valid, print it to the user; if not, ask the user to try again.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter your password: &gt; mypass
Your password is too short. Please enter a password of at least 8 characters.
Enter your password: &gt; mypassword123
You entered: mypassword123
</code></pre>
<p><strong> Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter your password: &gt; qwerty
Your password is too short. Please enter a password of at least 8 characters.
Enter your password: &gt; qwerty1234
You entered: qwerty1234
</code></pre>
