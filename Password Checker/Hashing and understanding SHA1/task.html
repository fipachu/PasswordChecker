<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>The concept of <strong>hashing</strong> is one of the most fundamental in information security. Hashing is a method of encoding data that makes decoding nearly impossible without the original input. This property makes it an invaluable tool for password storage and validation. You'll learn about the SHA1 hashing algorithm and how to use it in Python at this point.</p>
<p>By the end of this stage, your program will securely check if a password has been compromised.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>For this stage, your program should accomplish the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prompt the user to enter their password;</li>
<li>Hash the user's password using the SHA1 hashing algorithm;</li>
<li>Print the hashed password.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter your password: &gt; mypassword123
Your hashed password is: 1cf4c502ddd89b918c4bfefea76dadd590693b48
</code></pre>
