<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>One of the most fundamental concepts in programming is the interaction between the user and the computer. This is usually accomplished through user input and output to the console, which you'll implement in this stage. You don't need to check the password's strength or whether it's been exposed in a data breach; you'll simply be outputting the exact password the user inputted. </p>
<p>At the end of this stage, your program won't do much regarding password security, but you'll have a solid foundation to build upon in the later stages of the project. Remember, every great project starts with small steps!</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Your program should accomplish the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Display a message asking the user to input their password;</li>
<li>Take the user's password as input;</li>
<li>Display a message confirming that the password has been received, along with the input password.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter your password: &gt; mypassword123
You entered: mypassword123
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter your password: &gt; qwerty1234
You entered: qwerty1234
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter your password: &gt; securepassword
You entered: securepassword
</code></pre>
